# TokenizedVoting Smart Contract

## Vision

The **TokenizedVoting** smart contract is designed to facilitate decentralized voting on proposals using a token-based system. It enables users to create proposals and cast votes, ensuring that each participant can only vote once per proposal. This approach aims to enhance transparency and integrity in decision-making processes.

## Features

- **Create Proposal**:

  - Allows users to create new proposals for voting.

- **Vote on Proposal**:
  - Enables users to cast their votes ("Yes" or "No") on a proposal.
  - Ensures that each address can vote only once per proposal.

## Future Scope

1. **Voting Weight**:

   - Introduce mechanisms for weighted voting based on token holdings or other criteria.

2. **Proposal Expiry**:

   - Implement proposal expiry and automatic closure of voting after a set period.

3. **Vote Visibility**:

   - Add features to reveal voting results or make voting activity transparent to all participants.

4. **Proposal Categorization**:
   - Allow proposals to be categorized or tagged for easier management and tracking.

The **TokenizedVoting** contract aims to provide a secure and efficient voting mechanism for decentralized governance and decision-making, promoting active participation and fairness.
